# Vehicles Management Feature

## Overview

The Vehicles Management feature provides a comprehensive interface for administrators to view, search, filter, and manage vehicle listings in the SpokeHire system.

## Feature Components

### Backend (tRPC API)

#### Vehicle Router (`src/server/api/routers/vehicle.ts`)

**Procedures:**

1. **`list`** - Get paginated list of vehicles with filters
   - Input: Pagination, search, filters (status, makeIds, modelId, collectionIds, exteriorColors, interiorColors, year range, price, owner), sorting
   - Output: Array of vehicles with relations, next cursor, total count
   - Auth: Admin only
   - Features:
     - Full-text search across name, registration, description, make, model, owner (email, name, phone)
     - Multiple filter options with OR logic (makes, collections, colors)
     - Cursor-based pagination
     - Flexible sorting

2. **`getById`** - Get single vehicle with full details
   - Input: Vehicle ID
   - Output: Complete vehicle data with all relations
   - Auth: Admin only

3. **`updateStatus`** - Update vehicle status
   - Input: Vehicle ID, new status
   - Output: Updated vehicle
   - Auth: Admin only
   - Statuses: DRAFT, PUBLISHED, DECLINED, ARCHIVED

4. **`delete`** - Soft delete vehicle (archives it)
   - Input: Vehicle ID
   - Output: Archived vehicle
   - Auth: Admin only
   - Note: Soft delete by setting status to ARCHIVED

5. **`getFilterOptions`** - Get available filter options
   - Output: List of makes, collections (with colors), exterior colors, interior colors, years, status counts

- `VehicleListItem` - Type for list view with relations
- `VehicleDetail` - Type for detail view with full relations
- `VehicleFilters` - Filter options interface
- `VehicleSort` - Sort options types
- `VehiclePagination` - Pagination options

#### Utilities (`src/lib/vehicles.ts`)

#### Hooks (`src/hooks/useDebounce.ts`)
- `useDebounce()` - Debounce hook for search input
- Default delay: 300ms
- Prevents excessive API calls during typing

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Load**
   - Page component fetches vehicles using tRPC query
   - Reads initial filters from URL query parameters
   - Displays loading skeleton while fetching

2. **Search**
   - User types in search input
   - Input is debounced (300ms)
   - Debounced value updates URL params
   - tRPC query refetches with new search term

3. **Filtering**
   - User selects filter (status, make, model)
   - Filter state updates immediately
   - URL params update
   - tRPC query refetches with new filters

4. **Actions**
   - View: Navigate to `/admin/vehicles/[id]` (TODO)
   - Edit: Navigate to `/admin/vehicles/[id]/edit` (TODO)
   - Delete: Show confirmation, call delete mutation (TODO)

## URL State Management

All filters are synced to URL query parameters for:
- Shareable links
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmark-able filtered views

**Query Parameters:**
- `search` - Search term (vehicle and owner info)
- `status` - Vehicle status filter (default: PUBLISHED)
- `makeIds` - Comma-separated make IDs (OR logic)
- `modelId` - Model filter
- `collectionIds` - Comma-separated collection IDs (OR logic)
- `exteriorColors` - Comma-separated colors (OR logic)
- `interiorColors` - Comma-separated colors (OR logic)
- `yearFrom` - Year range start
- `yearTo` - Year range end

Example: `/admin/vehicles?search=john@example.com&status=PUBLISHED&makeIds=bmw-id,audi-id&collectionIds=classic-id&exteriorColors=Red,Blue&yearFrom=2000&yearTo=2020`

## UI/UX Features

### Responsive Design
- Desktop (≥ 768px): Table or Card view (user toggle)
- Mobile (< 768px): Card-based layout with stacked information
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44x44px)
- Filter row wraps on smaller screens

### Loading States
- Skeleton loader with 5 rows
- Matches table structure
- Smooth transition to real data

### Empty States
- No vehicles: Encourages adding first vehicle
- No results: Suggests clearing filters
- Different messages for each scenario

### Error Handling
- Toast notifications for errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Non-blocking (page stays functional)

### Performance
- Debounced search (prevents excessive API calls)
- Cursor-based pagination (efficient for large datasets)
- Only fetches needed relations
- URL state (no unnecessary refetches on navigation)

## Database Schema
